## The spirit of the competition

Remember that hackathons are like marathons. Some people go to compete but most people take part to better themselves and have fun. Whatever the reason is you're at a hackathon, make sure you're upholding the [hacker spirit](https://medium.com/@tfogo/the-spirit-of-hackathons-a0d81a65060a#.6cx5ac9t8) by collaborating with other teams, helping beginners, and having fun.


## The rules of the competition

1. Teams should be 2-4 people. Exceptions can be made for 5 person teams, but please note that for most categories we only provide prizes for 4 person teams. If you participate in a 5 person team and win a challenge, there might not be enough prizes for everyone on your team.
2. Teams should be made up exclusively of undergraduate students (or Dartmouth graduate students) who are not organizers, volunteers, judges, sponsors, or in any other privileged position at the event. 
3. All team members should be present at the event.
4. Teams can gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and others.

## Technical hacking rules

1. All work on a project should be done at the hackathon.
2. Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.
3. Teams are not allowed to crosspost to other hackathons on the same weekend.
4. Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. e.g. If during demoing your hack you find a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few lines of code, it's okay to fix that. Making large changes or adding new features is not allowed.
5. Projects should be submitted via Devpost. They must include a Github link and a completed Devpost description with a demo video.
6. Teams are not allowed to submit multiple projects.
7. To qualify for the beginner track, at least half the team must have this be their first hackathon.
8. Projects that violate the [Code of Conduct](http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf) are not allowed.
9. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the [Code of Conduct](http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf), or other unsporting behaviour.

## Demos

After hacking finishes, teams will show their projects the judges in a science fair style. More details about judging will come during the hackathon.

You are strongly encouraged to present a demo of what you have built. Pitches or presentations are discouraged. You are not judged on the quality of your pitch or the quality of your idea. As you are judged on what you built, you'll only hurt yourself by not showing a demo.

You are encouraged to present what you have done even if your hack is broken or you weren’t able to finish. It's okay if you didn't finish your hack—that happens all the time! Completion is only one part of the judging criteria, so you might still do well. Also, demoing is not just about the competition. It's a chance to share with others what you learned and what you tried to build—that's what hacking's all about! For being courageous enough to demo, you'll receive a special MLH "I Demoed" sticker—it doesn't matter how good the demo is! In the case that you don't have anything to demo, you can give a presentation about what you tried and what you learned. Hearing what other people learned is interesting and inspiring for other attendees.

Rules largely based on MLH hackathon rules.

Happy hacking!
